**Metamorphosis** is an utility library to ease conversions of objects.  
Most of development time is due to type conversions: from DTOs to entities, from entities to DTOs or from DTOs and other DTOs.  
Metamorphosis helps to write converters in a lean way and places them in a better structure within your project (further details in paragraphs below).

Metamorphosis supports several languages and frameworks:
* **[j-metamorphosis](https://github.com/fabioformosa/j-metamorphosis)** - Java with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* **[metamorphosis-js](https://github.com/fabioformosa/metamorphosis-js)** - (vanilla) Javascript/Typescript
* **[j-metamorphosis](https://github.com/fabioformosa/metamorphosis-nestjs)** - Typescript with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

# Conversion Service

Metamorphosis follows the model provided by Spring Framework for type conversions.  

**j-metamorphosis** offers an enabler of Spring Conversion Service by annotation and other utility class to write lean converters.  
**metamorphosis-nestjs** transposes to NestJS the concept of conversion service, missing in NestJS.  

The conversion service is a component of a general type conversion system. The system defines an SPI to implement type conversion logic and an API to perform type conversions at runtime
