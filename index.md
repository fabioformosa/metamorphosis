**Metamorphosis** is an utility library to ease conversions of objects.  
Most of development time is due to object conversions: from DTOs to entities, from entities to DTOs or from DTOs and other DTOs.  
Metamorphosis helps to write converters in a lean way and places them in a better structure within your project.

Metamorphosis supports several languages and frameworks:
* **[j-metamorphosis](https://github.com/fabioformosa/j-metamorphosis)** - Java with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* **[metamorphosis-js](https://github.com/fabioformosa/metamorphosis-js)** - (vanilla) Javascript/Typescript
* **[j-metamorphosis](https://github.com/fabioformosa/metamorphosis-nestjs)** - Typescript with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
